# MoviewReview

This is a sample application for a Movie Review Website.

We expect it to evolve into something that can do the following:

 * Movies + the usual data are visible to website visitors
 * Visitors can sign up for a free account
 * Movie Reviews can be added by users
 * Reviewers can give rating of 1-5
 * Rating for a movie is the average of all reviews
 * Users can vote up/down on other reviews
 * Users can comment on the reviews
 * Users can comment on the movies
 * Users can Favorite a reviewer
 * Users can search for movies with their favorite actor
 * Users can look for movies in a specific genre
 * Advanced movie rating is weighted based on popularity of review (voting score)
 * Users can create a list of "Movies I've Seen"
 * Users can create a "My Top Movies"
 * etc.
